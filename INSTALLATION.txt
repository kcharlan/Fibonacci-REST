INSTALL

No installation steps are required for this service itself or the functional
test routines. See the DEPENDENCIES section, which does have some components
that require installation into the environment.

Confirm execute permission on ./fibonacci.py, and then run the service with
./fibonacci.py in the directory the service resides in.

The service will continue to run until it receives an interrupt (signal,
control-C, etc.).

Confirm execute permission on ./func_tests.py, and then run the testing
routines with ./func_tests.py in the directory the program resides in. The
tests will run and output results to STDOUT.
