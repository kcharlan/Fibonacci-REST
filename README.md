# Fibonacci-REST
Fibonacci REST service

This project is a REST service that takes a single parameter as input, and outputs the Fibonacci sequence to the length specified.
For example, if the parameter is 8, then the first 8 Fibonacci numbers will be output in CSV format. The output is the modern
Fibonacci sequence which starts at 0 -> 0,1,1,2,...

Please see the included README.txt for detailed information.
